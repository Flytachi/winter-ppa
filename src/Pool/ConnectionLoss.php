/**
 * Tells a **lost connection** apart from an ordinary database error.
 *
 * The distinction is what makes eviction safe. A constraint violation (`23xxx`) or a
 * syntax error (`42xxx`) means the connection is perfectly healthy and the *query* was
 * wrong — throwing it away would churn the pool for nothing. A connection exception
 * means the socket is dead: keeping it would hand the corpse to the next borrower.
 *
 * Only the connection case is matched here, so
 * {@see PpaConnectionPool::reportFailure()} evicts exactly when it should.
 *
 * The classification reads the driver's own verdict — SQLSTATE and the driver error
 * code from `PDOException::$errorInfo` — walking the `previous` chain, because CDO
 * wraps the original `PDOException` inside a `CDOException`.
