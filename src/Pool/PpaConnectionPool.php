/**
 * PpaConnectionPool — driver-agnostic connection pool for FPM and Swoole.
 *
 * ## FPM (no coroutines)
 * Behaves identically to the original CDO `ConnectionPool`:
 * one `CDO` instance per config class per process, reused for the entire request.
 *
 * ## Swoole (coroutines)
 * Uses the framework's {@see ConnectionPool} (a HikariCP-inspired pool over a
 * `Swoole\Coroutine\Channel`) per config class. Connections are created **lazily** —
 * only when first requested, up to `poolMaxConnections`. On the **first** `db()` call
 * inside a coroutine one connection is borrowed and cached in the coroutine context;
 * a `defer` returns it automatically when the coroutine ends — no manual release
 * anywhere in the codebase.
 *
 * Unlike a plain `Swoole\ConnectionPool` (a dumb channel), {@see ConnectionPool}
 * actively keeps connections usable across a database outage: a connection idle beyond
 * `aliveBypassWindow` is probed on borrow ({@see CdoConnectionFactory::validate()} →
 * `ping()`) and a dead one is retired for a fresh socket, and a connection older than
 * `maxLifetime` is rotated before it can go stale — restoring the FPM-era resilience
 * (fresh connection ⇒ self-heal after recovery) without a per-borrow probe on hot
 * connections.
 *
 * ## Pool size
 * Configs that implement {@see PpaPoolConfigInterface} (via {@see PpaPoolTrait})
 * control `poolMaxConnections` and `poolWaitTimeout`.
 * Configs that do NOT implement the interface default to {@see DEFAULT_POOL_SIZE}
 * connections (Swoole only — FPM uses a single {@see $static} CDO and never
 * touches the pool). The default is a modest middle ground: it unblocks
 * coroutine concurrency without letting `worker_num × poolMax × instances`
 * exhaust the database connection limit. Deployments with high concurrency
 * should implement {@see PpaPoolConfigInterface} and tune the size against
 * their database `max_connections`.
 *
 * ## Works with every CDO driver
 * The pool operates on `CDO` objects produced by `DbConfigInterface::connection()`,
 * so it is driver-agnostic — pgsql, mysql, oci, sqlite — anything CDO supports.
 *
